My name is **Pasha Koval**. My pronouns are *he/him/his*. I am a post-doctoral associate in [Jon Sprouse's lab](https://www.jonsprouse.com/lab.html) at [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/science/academic-programs/psychology.html/). I received my Ph.D. and M.A. from the [University of Connecitut](https://linguistics.uconn.edu/) and my other M.A. from the [Lomonosov Moscow State University](http://tipl.philol.msu.ru/).

I am an experimental syntactician. My research aims to identify the sources of linear information in the syntactic component of human language. The strong null hypothesis at the core of my approach is that all syntactic computations do not rely on linear information. Therefore, all precedence relations in a sentence can be determined from its hierarchical structure and the way the speaker fits this structure into the time-locked linear speech channel. To this end, I use experimental syntax methods to test predictions that different syntactic theories make about the way linear information is represented during a particular syntactic operation. The current focus of my research program is on syntactic and non-syntactic forms of rightward movement.
