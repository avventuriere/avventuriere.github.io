My name is Pasha Koval. My pronouns are he, him, his. I am a post-doctoral associate in Jon Sprouse's lab at New York University Abu Dhabi. I received my Ph.D. and my second M.A. from the University of Connecitut and my first M.A. from the Lomonosov Moscow State University. 

I am an experimental syntactician. I am interested in the sources of linear information in the syntactic structure.
